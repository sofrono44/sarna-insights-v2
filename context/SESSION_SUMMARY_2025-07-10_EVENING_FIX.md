# Session Summary - AI Assistant Integration Fixed

## Date: July 10, 2025 (Evening Session)

## Overview
Successfully fixed the broken AI Assistant implementation and integrated it with real Sarna API data. The main page loading issue was resolved, and the chat functionality now works with the backend. Visualization parsing remains to be completed.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Frontend Loading Error
**Problem**: Application wouldn't load - "date-fns" module not found
**Root Cause**: Package was in package.json but not installed in container
**Solution**: Rebuilt frontend container with proper dependency installation
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build frontend
```

### 2. gRPC Field Mapping Error
**Problem**: Backend throwing "LongStockValue" error when fetching portfolio data
**Root Cause**: Trying to access non-existent fields in PmBpValues protobuf
**Solution**: Updated field mappings in grpc_client.py:
```python
# OLD (incorrect fields)
"long_stock_value": pm_values.LongStockValue,
"net_liquidity": pm_values.NetLiquidation,

# NEW (correct fields from proto)
"nav": pm_values.NAV,
"requirement": pm_values.Requirement,
"buying_power": pm_values.BuyingPower,
```

### 3. Project Organization
**Problem**: Test files cluttering root directory
**Solution**: Moved all test files to `/tests/manual/` directory

## Current Working State

### ✅ Frontend
- AI Assistant split-view layout renders correctly
- Chat panel accepts messages and shows responses
- Visualization panel ready to display charts/tables
- No console errors, page loads cleanly

### ✅ Backend
- Chat endpoint (`/api/chat/query`) processes queries successfully
- Connects to Sarna staging API without errors
- Returns portfolio data with correct field mappings
- LLM integration works with all three providers

### ⚠️ Visualization Parsing (Pending)
- LLMs return visualization JSON within their responses
- Parser fails due to single quotes in JSON (invalid syntax)
- Started implementing fix but needs completion
- Example problematic response:
```json
{
  "backgroundColor": ['rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.6)']  // Single quotes!
}
```

## Code Changes Made

### `/backend/services/grpc_client.py`
Fixed PmBpValues field access to use actual protobuf fields:
- NAV instead of NetLiquidation
- Requirement instead of MaintenanceRequirement
- Removed non-existent fields (LongStockValue, ShortStockValue, etc.)

### `/backend/routers/chat.py`
Added initial parsing for JSON code blocks:
```python
# Added regex to find ```json blocks
json_block_match = re.search(r'```json\s*(.*?)\s*```', response, re.DOTALL)

# Started implementing single quote fix
json_str = re.sub(r"'([^']*)'", r'"\1"', json_str)
```

## Testing Results

### Successful Queries
```bash
# Basic query - works
POST /api/chat/query
{
  "question": "What are my total margin requirements?",
  "provider": "google"
}
Response: "Your total margin requirement across all accounts is $0..."

# Visualization query - returns response but no visualization
{
  "question": "Create a bar chart showing buying power",
  "provider": "google"  
}
Response: Contains chart data but visualization: null
```

### Portfolio Data
- Successfully loading 9 accounts from group 10006
- Total buying power: $31,086,565.14
- All accounts show 0 positions (test data characteristic)
- Margin requirements show as $0

## Next Session Plan

### Priority 1: Complete Visualization Parsing
1. Implement robust JSON cleaning:
   - Handle single quotes properly
   - Deal with escaped quotes
   - Strip markdown formatting

2. Test with different visualization types:
   - Charts (bar, line, pie)
   - Tables
   - Risk matrices

3. Add fallback visualization generation if parsing fails

### Priority 2: Polish Integration
1. Add loading states in UI
2. Implement error boundaries
3. Test with various query patterns
4. Ensure visualizations render correctly

## Useful Commands for Next Session

```powershell
# Quick test of visualization parsing
$body = @{
    question = "Show me a chart of account NAV values"
    provider = "google"
    include_historical = $false
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost/api/chat/query `
    -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" `
    -UseBasicParsing | Select -Expand Content | ConvertFrom-Json
```

## Session Time Tracking
- Start: Reviewed project state and identified issues
- 15%: Fixed frontend dependency issue
- 35%: Resolved gRPC field mapping errors
- 55%: Attempted visualization parsing fix
- 70%: Cleaned up project structure and documented

## Final Status
✅ AI Assistant page loads and functions
✅ Chat queries work with real Sarna data
⚠️ Visualization parsing needs completion
✅ Project organization improved
