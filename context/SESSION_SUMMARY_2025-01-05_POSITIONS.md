# Session Summary - January 5, 2025

## Session Overview
This session focused on fixing the gRPC authentication and getting position data from the Sarna API. We discovered that account 10006 is both an account group ID and an individual account, which was causing confusion.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed gRPC Authentication
- **Issue**: Getting "Fatal Error" responses from the API
- **Root Cause**: Wrong authentication header format
- **Solution**: Changed from `x-jwt-token` to `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
- **Result**: Successfully connecting to Sarna API

### 2. Resolved Account Structure Confusion
- **Discovery**: Account 10006 serves dual purpose:
  - As an account group ID (contains all accounts including TS accounts)
  - As an individual account (1SN10001) with different data structure
- **Solution**: 
  - Use account group 10006 to fetch all data
  - Filter out accounts 10006 and 10028 from display
  - Only show TS accounts (10139-10145)

### 3. Got Position Data Working (Partially)
- **Success**: Position extraction now works for some accounts:
  - TS1 (10141): 1 position - SPY (2000 shares)
  - TS4 (10144): 2 positions - QQQ (200 shares) + QQQ call option (-2 contracts)
- **Issue**: Other TS accounts show 0 positions when they likely have positions
- **Risk Scenarios**: Successfully extracting 15 price scenarios (-15% to +15%)

### 4. Enhanced Position Extraction Logic
- **Added support for two data structures**:
  - TS accounts: PortfolioGroups directly under Groupings
  - Account 10006: PortfolioAggregations structure
- **Protobuf handling**: Properly converting protobuf objects to dicts
- **Risk matrix data**: Extracting gains/losses for each scenario

## Technical Discoveries

### Critical Request Parameters
```json
{
  "FetchAllAccounts": true,  // Must be true to get all accounts
  "NumberOfScenarios": 0,    // Let risk profile generate scenarios
  "AppliedRiskProfileIds": [10011],  // Generates 15 scenarios
  "AccountGroupIds": [10006] // The only group that contains TS accounts
}
```

### Authentication Format
```python
# Wrong:
metadata = [("x-jwt-token", jwt_token)]

# Correct:
metadata = [("authorization", f"Bearer {jwt_token}")]
```

### Position Data Structure
- Positions are nested: PortfolioGroups → ProductGroups → ClassGroups → Products
- Each position includes:
  - Basic info (symbol, quantity, price)
  - 15 risk scenarios with gains/losses
  - Greeks for options
  - P&L metrics

## Current Issues

### 1. Incomplete Position Extraction
- Only 2 out of 7 TS accounts showing positions
- **Accounts showing positions may not be showing ALL their positions**
- TS1 shows 1 position but may have more
- TS4 shows 2 positions but may have more
- Need to investigate why other accounts show 0 positions
- Possibly different data structures for different account types

### 2. Partial Position Display
- Current extraction might stop after finding first set of positions
- Multiple PortfolioGroups/ProductGroups might not all be processed
- Need to ensure complete traversal of data hierarchy

### 3. Next Steps for Position Extraction
- Add more detailed logging for complete hierarchy traversal
- Track how many groups at each level are processed
- Verify all loops complete without early termination
- Compare structure of working accounts with expected position counts

## Files Modified
1. `/backend/services/grpc_client.py` - Fixed authentication header, updated request params
2. `/backend/services/portfolio_service.py` - Enhanced position extraction, added account filtering
3. Frontend components - Reverted to use account group 10006

## Key Insights
1. Account group 10006 is the gateway to TS accounts
2. Different accounts may have different data structures
3. Position extraction logic works but needs refinement
4. The API is returning data but we're not extracting all of it

## Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Check which accounts have positions
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/data/portfolio/10006/risk-matrix | \
  jq '.accounts[] | {id: .account_id, num: .account_number, positions: .positions_count}'
```

## Session Duration
Approximately 3.5 hours

## Session Consumption
85-90% of chat context used

## Next Session Focus
1. Debug why some TS accounts show 0 positions
2. Add comprehensive logging to trace data structure
3. Complete position extraction for all accounts
4. Verify frontend display of the data
