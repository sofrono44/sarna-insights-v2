# Session Summary - July 10, 2025 - Frontend Risk Matrix Complete

## Session Overview
This session focused on implementing the frontend risk matrix display with all 15 scenarios and fixing several UI issues.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Initial Testing & Issue Discovery
- Verified backend is returning all 15 risk scenarios correctly
- Discovered alert service returns UNIMPLEMENTED in staging
- Identified frontend was not reflecting recent changes

### 2. Frontend Risk Matrix Implementation
- Updated PortfolioEnhanced component to v3.0
- Implemented all requested UI fixes:
  - Risk scenarios default to visible
  - Simplified column headers (removed "S1:", "S2:", etc.)
  - Added "IV" indicator to columns with volatility impacts
  - Fixed 0% scenario to show NAV values instead of $0
  - Removed redundant "Positions for [Account]" headers
  - Added tooltips to all risk value cells

### 3. Resolved Technical Issues
- Fixed JSX syntax errors in the component
- Implemented workaround for backend 0% scenario bug
- Ensured proper 3-row display for options with volatility shocks

## Technical Implementation Details

### Column Headers
- Now show clean percentage values: "-15%", "-12%", "0%", "+15%", etc.
- Columns with IV impacts show "IV" suffix: "-15% IV", "-10% IV", etc.

### Tooltips
All risk value cells now have tooltips showing:
- Main rows: "Px -15%, IV +50%/-20%" (example)
- Volatility Up rows: "Px -15%, IV +50%/-20% (Volatility Up)"
- Volatility Down rows: "Px -15%, IV +50%/-20% (Volatility Down)"

### 0% Scenario Fix
Frontend now detects when scenario 8 (0% shock) returns gains_losses of 0 and substitutes the position's NAV value.

## Current State
- Risk matrix fully functional with intuitive display
- All 33 positions showing with proper risk calculations
- Options display with 3-row format (main, vol up, vol down)
- Clean, professional UI with helpful tooltips

## Next Steps
1. Implement alert frontend components
2. Fix backend 0% scenario bug
3. Investigate credit utilization showing 0%
4. Check if alert service works in production
