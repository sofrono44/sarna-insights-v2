# Session Summary - July 10, 2025 - Complete Dashboard Redesign

## Session Overview
This session completed a major redesign of the dashboard, implementing comprehensive alert systems, message notifications, and specialized monitoring cards for margin calls, pattern day trader alerts, and liquidation warnings.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Alert System Implementation
- Created complete alert infrastructure with types, components, and mock data
- Implemented AlertBadge, AlertIcon, AlertList, and AlertPanel components
- Integrated alerts throughout the application with visual indicators
- Alert icons appear next to affected accounts in the portfolio table
- Created useAlerts hook for centralized alert management

### 2. Dashboard Card Transformation
Completely redesigned the top metric cards:

#### Active Alerts Card
- Shows total open alerts with severity breakdown
- Clickable to open alert panel
- Color-coded badge (red for critical, yellow for warning)
- Integrates with existing alert system

#### Calls Card (formerly Portfolio Risk Score)
- Displays Federal and House margin calls
- Shows count with breakdown (e.g., "2 Fed, 1 House")
- Dedicated drawer with detailed call information
- Highlights overdue calls in red

#### Pattern Day Trader Card (formerly Credit Utilization)
- Tracks PDT-flagged accounts
- Shows approaching/flagged/restricted status
- Displays equity vs minimum required
- Helps prevent trading violations

#### Liquidation Alerts Card (formerly Excess Liquidity)
- Monitors positions requiring liquidation
- Shows EOD (end of day) liquidations
- Prioritized by urgency (immediate/eod/warning)
- Displays position details and reasons

### 3. Message System Implementation
- Replaced alert bell with envelope icon
- Badge shows unread message count (6)
- Comprehensive message drawer with categories:
  - Risk Management messages
  - Compliance notifications
  - Operations updates
  - Trading desk alerts
- Messages have priority levels and timestamps

### 4. Common Drawer Component
- Created reusable Drawer component for consistent UI
- Used across all notification systems
- Smooth animations and backdrop
- Responsive design

### 5. Mock Data Infrastructure
Created comprehensive mock data for all systems:
- `mockMessages`: 6 messages across different categories
- `mockCalls`: 3 margin calls (Fed and House)
- `mockPDTAlerts`: 3 PDT alerts with different statuses
- `mockLiquidationAlerts`: 4 liquidation warnings
- `mockAlerts`: Original alert system data
