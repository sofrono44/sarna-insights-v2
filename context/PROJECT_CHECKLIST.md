# Project Checklist - Sarna Insights v2

## ‚úÖ Working Features
- [x] Backend API fully functional
- [x] gRPC authentication with Sarna API
- [x] Redis caching for performance
- [x] Multi-LLM provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- [x] Portfolio data endpoint with risk matrix structure
- [x] Recursive position extraction (33 positions found)
- [x] Data anonymization service
- [x] Frontend UI with sidebar navigation
- [x] Portfolio table with expandable rows
- [x] Column selector for risk scenarios
- [x] Professional styling and layout
- [x] Real-time data refresh capability

## üöß Features In Progress
