# Session Summary - July 10, 2025 - AI Assistant Split-View (Page Broken)

## ⚠️ WARNING: Application is currently broken and needs fixing

## Session Overview
Attempted to implement a split-view layout for the AI Risk Assistant that would allow users to generate visualizations from chat queries. While all components were created and the backend was enhanced, the frontend is currently not loading due to compilation or runtime errors.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Component Structure Created
Created complete AI assistant system in `/frontend/src/components/ai-assistant/`:
- `AIAssistantLayout.tsx` - Main split-view container
- `ChatPanel.tsx` - Enhanced chat interface
- `VisualizationPanel.tsx` - Display area for charts/tables
- `MessageBubble.tsx` - Individual message component
- `SuggestedQueries.tsx` - Quick-start queries
- `types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `index.ts` - Barrel exports

### 2. Visualization Components
Created in `/frontend/src/components/ai-assistant/visualizations/`:
- `ChartVisualization.tsx` - Chart.js integration
- `TableVisualization.tsx` - Sortable data tables  
- `RiskMatrixVisualization.tsx` - Risk matrix display

### 3. Backend Enhancement (Working)
Successfully updated `/backend/routers/chat.py` to:
- Return structured visualization data
- Parse LLM responses for visualization instructions
- Generate automatic visualizations for common queries
- Support multiple visualization types

### 4. App.tsx Updated
Modified to use AIAssistantLayout wrapping the dashboard content

## What Went Wrong

The page is not loading, likely due to:
1. Import errors in the new components
2. Missing dependencies (date-fns was installed)
3. TypeScript type mismatches
4. JSX syntax errors
5. Possible circular dependencies

## Current State

### Working (Before AI Assistant):
- Complete dashboard with alert system
- Message notifications
- Portfolio risk view
- All drawers and cards
- Backend API endpoints

### Broken:
- Frontend won't load at all
- Need to check browser console and Docker logs
- All new AI assistant components untested

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- 10+ new component files in `/frontend/src/components/ai-assistant/`
- All properly structured with TypeScript

### Modified Files:
- `/frontend/src/App.tsx` - Changed to use AIAssistantLayout
- `/backend/routers/chat.py` - Complete rewrite (working)
- `/frontend/package.json` - Added date-fns

## Next Session Priority

### Must Do First:
1. Debug why page won't load
2. Check browser console errors
3. Review Docker logs
4. Fix import/compilation issues
5. Get back to working state

### Then Complete:
1. Test AI assistant functionality
2. Connect visualizations to real data
3. Implement error handling
4. Add loading states
5. Test complete workflow

## Lessons Learned
- Should have tested incrementally
- Feature branch would have been safer
- Need to check browser immediately after changes
- Complex UI changes need step-by-step validation

## Recovery Plan
```bash
# Option 1: Fix forward
- Debug specific errors
- Fix imports/types
- Test each component

# Option 2: Revert and redo
git stash
git checkout .
# Then implement more carefully
```

## Duration
~2.5 hours (including implementation and documentation)

## Status
❌ Frontend broken - needs immediate fix
✅ Backend enhancements complete
✅ Component structure sound (once fixed)
⚠️ No testing completed due to broken state
