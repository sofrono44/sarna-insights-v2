## July 10, 2025 - Risk Matrix Backend Implementation
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Focus**: Implement full 15-scenario risk matrix with volatility shocks

### Accomplishments:
- Successfully retrieved all 15 risk scenarios from Sarna API
- Fixed gRPC request to match exact Sarna format
- Updated backend to extract VolatilityUpShock and VolatilityDownShock data
- Verified data structure: options get 3 rows (main + volatility up/down)
- Using risk profile 10011 now returns proper scenario data

### Technical Solution:
- Match exact request format from Sarna samples
- Key settings: FetchAllAccounts=false, OptionPricingModel=7, RiskProfile=10011

## January 5, 2025 (Evening) - Position Extraction Fixed!
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Focus**: Fix position data extraction for all account types

### Accomplishments:
- Diagnosed why only 3 of 33 positions were showing
- Discovered accounts had different data structure patterns
- Implemented recursive search algorithm to find positions by Symbol field

### Technical Solution:
- Replaced hierarchy navigation with recursive search
- Looks for any object with "Symbol" field (defining characteristic of positions)
- Works regardless of nesting structure

### Results:
- Before: 3 positions (TS1: 1, TS4: 2)
- After: 33 positions (TS1: 2, TS2: 21, TS3: 1, TS4: 6, TS5: 2, TS6: 1)
