# Current Project State - Sarna Insights v2

**Last Updated**: July 3, 2025
**Project Phase**: gRPC Connection Working - Ready for Service Implementation
**Next Action**: Refactor anonymization service and implement caching

## ✅ Completed
- [x] Full directory structure created
- [x] Docker configuration for all services
- [x] Backend API structure (FastAPI)
- [x] Frontend structure (React + TypeScript)
- [x] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [x] Data anonymization service
- [x] Multi-provider LLM service
- [x] Caching layer design
- [x] .env file in place
- [x] Proto files in place
- [x] Generate Python files from protos
- [x] Implement gRPC client methods with actual proto imports
- [x] Organize generated files into logical directory structure
- [x] Create documentation for gRPC integration
- [x] Fix Docker setup and proto import issues
- [x] Backend running successfully with all dependencies
- [x] Test connection to Sarna API - WORKING!
- [x] Fix proto generation script to prevent future issues
- [x] Document critical fixes for future sessions

## 🚧 In Progress
- [ ] Refactor anonymization logic into separate data_anonymizer.py service
- [ ] Implement Redis caching service as per spec
- [ ] Create API endpoints (chat, data, visualizations)
- [ ] Build frontend components following spec structure
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend API

## 🎯 Next Session Tasks
1. Test connection to Sarna API using test_grpc_connection.py
2. Refactor: Move anonymization from grpc_client.py to data_anonymizer.py service
3. Implement cache_service.py with Redis integration
4. Create time_machine.py service wrapper
5. Build API routers as per spec: chat.py, data.py, visualizations.py
6. Start implementing frontend components following exact spec structure

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made
- Using Docker-first approach for consistency
- PII stripping happens in backend before LLM calls
- Historical data cached forever (immutable)
- Current data cached for 30 seconds
- Manual refresh button instead of real-time updates
- PostgreSQL for app data, Redis for caching
- Multi-provider LLM with runtime switching
- Using postgresql+asyncpg:// for async database connections

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Query response time: < 3 seconds
- Zero PII sent to LLMs
- Support for 7 accounts under group 10006
- Working visualizations for demo

## 📝 Session Notes (July 3, 2025)
- Successfully tested gRPC connection to Sarna API!
- Fixed critical issues:
  - Proto import problems (api_hub_enums and api_hub service files)
  - Changed from insecure to secure gRPC channel for TLS
  - Fixed SARNA_API_URL format in .env (removed https://)
- Updated generate-protos.sh with Step 7 to prevent future issues
- Discovered group 10006 has 9 accounts (not 7 as documented)
- Account IDs come pre-anonymized from API (ACCOUNT_XXXXX format)
- Created CRITICAL_FIXES_2025-07-03.md documentation
- Ready to proceed with service implementation

## 📝 Previous Session Notes (June 30, 2025)
- Fixed critical Docker setup issues:
  - Proto file generation now works correctly with proper import paths
  - Updated Dockerfile to use full requirements.txt (not minimal)
  - Fixed SQLAlchemy async connection by converting DATABASE_URL to use asyncpg
  - Created fix_proto_imports.py script to handle import path corrections
- Key discovery: TimeMachineService is in api_hub_service.proto, not time_machine.proto
- Backend is now running successfully on port 8000
- All proto files properly organized:
  - /backend/generated/admin/ - Admin services
  - /backend/generated/api_hub/ - API Hub services (includes TimeMachineService)
  - /backend/generated/time_machine/ - Time Machine message definitions only
- Ready to test actual API connection in next session

## 📝 Previous Session Notes (Dec 30, 2024)
- Successfully generated protobuf files from proto definitions
- Discovered TimeMachineService is in api_hub_service.proto, not time_machine.proto
- Organized generated files into logical directory structure (admin/, api_hub/, time_machine/)
- Implemented complete gRPC client with margin and historical data methods
- Created comprehensive documentation for gRPC integration
- **Spec Alignment Review**: 90% aligned with original spec
  - Core architecture matches perfectly
  - Need to refactor anonymization into separate service
  - Need to implement service layer as specified
  - Proto discoveries were handled appropriately
