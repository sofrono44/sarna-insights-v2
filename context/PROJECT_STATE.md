- [x] Backend running successfully with all dependencies
- [x] Test connection to Sarna API - WORKING!
- [x] Fix proto generation script to prevent future issues
- [x] Document critical fixes for future sessions
- [x] Historical data retrieval working
- [x] Cache service fully integrated (Redis)
- [x] All data endpoints with caching
- [x] Visualization endpoints implemented
- [x] Time machine service for historical analysis
- [x] Test LLM service - ALL providers working perfectly!

## 🚧 In Progress
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend API
- [ ] Implement chat interface in frontend
- [ ] Build visualization components

## 🎯 Next Session Tasks
1. Test LLM service with actual API keys
2. Build minimal frontend demo:
   - Chat interface
   - Portfolio overview
   - One visualization
   - Refresh button
3. End-to-end testing
4. Performance optimization if needed
5. Prepare demo script

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made
- Using Docker-first approach for consistency
- PII stripping happens in backend before LLM calls
- Historical data cached forever (immutable)
- Current data cached for 30 seconds
- Manual refresh button instead of real-time updates
- PostgreSQL for app data, Redis for caching
- Multi-provider LLM with runtime switching
- Using postgresql+asyncpg:// for async database connections

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Query response time: < 3 seconds
- Zero PII sent to LLMs
- Support for 7 accounts under group 10006
- Working visualizations for demo

## 📝 Session Notes (July 3, 2025 - Session 3)
- Successfully fixed Anthropic provider:
  - ✅ Updated library to v0.57.1 (from v0.8.0)
  - ✅ Fixed system prompt handling (only pass when not None)
  - ✅ All three LLM providers now working perfectly
- Provider performance comparison:
  - Google Gemini: 1.3s (FASTEST!)
  - Anthropic Claude: 4.9s
  - OpenAI GPT-4: 11.6s
- Backend is fully complete and ready for frontend integration

## 📝 Session Notes (July 3, 2025 - LLM Testing)
- Successfully tested LLM providers:
  - ✅ OpenAI working perfectly (11-17s response time)
  - ✅ Google Gemini working perfectly (1-2s response time - FASTEST!)
  - ❌ Anthropic not working due to old library version (0.8.0)
- Updated Google provider to use gemini-1.5-flash model
- Both working providers respect PII anonymization
- Provider switching works between OpenAI and Google
- Created comprehensive LLM testing documentation
- Ready to proceed with frontend implementation

## 📝 Previous Session Notes (June 30, 2025)
- Fixed critical Docker setup issues:
  - Proto file generation now works correctly with proper import paths
  - Updated Dockerfile to use full requirements.txt (not minimal)
  - Fixed SQLAlchemy async connection by converting DATABASE_URL to use asyncpg
  - Created fix_proto_imports.py script to handle import path corrections
- Key discovery: TimeMachineService is in api_hub_service.proto, not time_machine.proto
- Backend is now running successfully on port 8000
- All proto files properly organized:
  - /backend/generated/admin/ - Admin services
  - /backend/generated/api_hub/ - API Hub services (includes TimeMachineService)
  - /backend/generated/time_machine/ - Time Machine message definitions only
- Ready to test actual API connection in next session

## 📝 Previous Session Notes (Dec 30, 2024)
- Successfully generated protobuf files from proto definitions
- Discovered TimeMachineService is in api_hub_service.proto, not time_machine.proto
- Organized generated files into logical directory structure (admin/, api_hub/, time_machine/)
- Implemented complete gRPC client with margin and historical data methods
- Created comprehensive documentation for gRPC integration
- **Spec Alignment Review**: 90% aligned with original spec
  - Core architecture matches perfectly
  - Need to refactor anonymization into separate service
  - Need to implement service layer as specified
  - Proto discoveries were handled appropriately
