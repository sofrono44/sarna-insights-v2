# Session Summary - July 3, 2025

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Successfully Tested gRPC Connection ‚úÖ
- Fixed proto import issues that resurfaced after Docker rebuild
- Changed from insecure to secure gRPC channel
- Fixed SARNA_API_URL format (removed https:// prefix)
- Connection now working reliably with group 10006 data

### 2. Future-Proofed the Project üõ°Ô∏è
- Modified `.gitignore` to commit generated proto files to version control
- Updated `grpc_client.py` to automatically use TLS based on configuration
- Enhanced `generate-protos.sh` with Step 7 for additional import fixes
- Documented all critical fixes in `CRITICAL_FIXES_2025-07-03.md`

### 3. Key Discoveries üîç
- Account group 10006 has **9 accounts** (not 7 as originally documented)
- Account IDs come **pre-anonymized** from Sarna API as ACCOUNT_XXXXX
- TimeMachineService is in `api_hub_service.proto` (confirmed)
- Total margin: $207,702.43
- Total buying power: $31,068,214.42

## Files Modified/Created

1. **Created**:
   - `/context/CRITICAL_FIXES_2025-07-03.md` - Comprehensive fix documentation
   - `/context/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-07-03.md` - This summary

2. **Modified**:
   - `.env` - Fixed SARNA_API_URL format
   - `.env.example` - Added clear documentation about URL format
   - `.gitignore` - Added exception to commit proto files
   - `/backend/core/config.py` - Added RISK_SYSTEM_USE_TLS setting
   - `/backend/services/grpc_client.py` - TLS auto-configuration
   - `/scripts/generate-protos.sh` - Added Step 7 with critical fixes
   - `/context/PROJECT_STATE.md` - Updated current status
   - `/context/PROJECT_INFO.md` - Corrected account count
   - `/context/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md` - Added new discoveries
   - `/backend/GRPC_INTEGRATION.md` - Enhanced troubleshooting guide
   - `README.md` - Comprehensive update with all fixes

## Protection Against Future Issues

The project is now protected against proto/connection issues through:
1. **Version Control**: Generated proto files are committed
2. **Automation**: TLS configuration based on settings
3. **Documentation**: Clear instructions in multiple places
4. **Script Improvements**: Proto generation includes all necessary fixes

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed with service implementation:
1. Refactor anonymization service (though data comes pre-anonymized)
2. Implement Redis caching layer
3. Create API endpoints (chat, data, visualizations)
4. Build frontend components
5. Connect frontend to backend

## Time Spent

- Debugging proto imports: ~45 minutes
- Implementing future-proofing: ~20 minutes
- Documentation updates: ~15 minutes
- Total session: ~80 minutes

## Status: ‚úÖ READY FOR SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION
