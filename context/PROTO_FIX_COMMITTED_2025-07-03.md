# Proto Files Finally Committed - July 3, 2025

## The Problem
Despite documentation claiming proto files were committed to prevent import issues, they were never actually committed to git. This caused the same import errors to recur every session when Docker regenerated the files.

## The Solution
Generated proto files with all import fixes have now been committed:
```bash
git add backend/generated/
git commit -m "Commit generated proto files with import fixes - permanent solution to recurring import issues"
```

## What This Means
- Proto import issues should NOT recur in future sessions
- Docker builds will use the committed files instead of regenerating
- All import fixes are now permanently preserved in version control

## Verification
To verify files are committed:
```bash
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: fa897d6 Commit generated proto files with import fixes...

git ls-files backend/generated/*.py | wc -l
# Should show 100+ files tracked by git
```

## If Issues Return
If proto import issues somehow return:
1. Check if someone ran proto generation without committing
2. Run: `git status backend/generated/`
3. If files show as modified, commit them again
4. Consider adding a pre-commit hook to prevent uncommitted proto files

This commit should end the cycle of fixing the same import issues every session.
