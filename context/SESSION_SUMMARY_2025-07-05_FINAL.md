# Session Summary - July 5, 2025 (Final)

## Session Overview
This session focused on implementing enhanced portfolio features including expandable position rows, column selector, and risk matrix columns. We also addressed data structure issues and filtered out problematic accounts.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Enhanced PortfolioEnhanced Component
- **Expandable Row Support**: Added chevron icons and click handlers for accounts with positions
- **Column Selector**: Implemented dropdown to show/hide columns with:
  - Individual column checkboxes
  - "Toggle All Risk Scenarios" button
  - Persistent visibility state
- **Risk Matrix Columns**: Added 15 price scenario columns (-10% to +20%) with:
  - Color-coded values (green for positive, red/orange for negative)
  - Placeholder calculations using random values
  - Proper alignment and formatting

### 2. Fixed Backend Data Processing
- **Handled Multiple Data Structures**: 
  - Most accounts have PortfolioAggregations as dict
  - Account 10006 has PortfolioAggregations as list
  - Added logic to handle both cases
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks and logging throughout
- **Position Extraction**: Set up proper hierarchy traversal (PortfolioGroups → ProductGroups → ClassGroups → Products)

### 3. Account Filtering
- **Excluded Problematic Accounts**: Removed accounts 10006 and 10028 from display
- **Clean TS Account View**: Now showing only TS0-TS6 accounts
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simplified debugging by focusing on consistent account structures

## Technical Discoveries

### Data Structure Insights
```
Account 10006 (1SN10001):
- PortfolioAggregations: list with 2 items
- Has actual positions but different structure
- Shows both long and short positions

TS Accounts (TS0-TS6):
- PortfolioAggregations: dict
- Empty PortfolioGroups arrays
- No position data in test environment
```

### Current Data Flow
1. gRPC API returns comprehensive margin data
2. Portfolio service processes accounts and attempts position extraction
3. All TS accounts return 0 positions due to empty PortfolioGroups
4. Frontend displays account-level data correctly but no positions

## Files Modified
1. `/frontend/src/components/visualizations/PortfolioEnhanced.tsx` - Complete rewrite with enhanced features
2. `/backend/services/portfolio_service.py` - Fixed data structure handling and added account filtering
3. `/frontend/src/App.tsx` - Cleaned up and removed test components

## Current Application State

### Working Features:
1. **Portfolio Table**: Shows 7 TS accounts with all financial metrics
2. **Column Selector**: Fully functional with all columns toggleable
3. **Risk Matrix**: 15 scenario columns with color-coded values
4. **Data Filtering**: Successfully excludes problematic accounts
5. **Responsive Design**: Table handles horizontal scroll for many columns

### Not Working (Due to Data):
1. **Position Display**: No positions to show in expandable rows
2. **Position Counts**: All show 0 because PortfolioGroups are empty
3. **Risk Calculations**: Using placeholder values instead of real position risk

## Next Session Priority

### 1. Fix Position Data Extraction
The main issue is that TS accounts have empty PortfolioGroups. Need to:
- Investigate why gRPC returns empty position data
- Check if different API parameters are needed
- Consider using a different risk profile ID
- Debug the actual protobuf response structure

### 2. Complete Credit Utilization Migration
- Fix credit utilization calculations (currently all show 0%)
- Update CreditUtilizationChart component
- Re-add RiskMetricsCards with credit data

### 3. Real Risk Matrix Values
- Once positions are loading, calculate real risk scenarios
- Implement proper P&L calculations for each price shock
- Add volatility shock rows for options

## Quick Start for Next Session
```bash
# Start services
cd C:\Development\sarna-insights-v2
docker-compose up -d

# Check that only TS accounts show
http://localhost

# Debug position data
docker-compose logs -f backend | grep -i position
```

## Key Insights
1. The gRPC API is returning data but positions are empty for TS accounts
2. Account 10006 has a different structure and actual positions
3. Column selector and risk matrix UI are fully functional
4. Performance is good even with 24 columns displayed
