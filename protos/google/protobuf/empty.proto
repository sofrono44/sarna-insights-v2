// Taken from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/empty.proto
// We need source .proto files in order to generate Dart code and since we only need this file and not the whole
// protobuf repository this seems to easier to manage.
//
// Note that this file must be a package of "google.protobuf" because it a well known package and
// Dart plugin generates special code for it.
//
// https://github.com/dart-lang/protobuf/blob/aac6fc4253b0d0cc4ac5187dc9585c6cc6579769/protoc_plugin/test/protos/google/protobuf/unittest_well_known_types.proto
//
// Different approach can be found here:
// https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dart/blob/master/example/googleapis/tool/regenerate.sh
//
// Alternatively we could do a script that would find this file inside protoc install, but
// thats a bit too much work.

// A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
// empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
// or the response type of an API method. For instance:
//
//     service Foo {
//       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
//     }
//
// The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
